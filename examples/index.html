      <p>
        Earlier 3D human body models mainly focused on representing different body shapes but had difficulty handling realistic pose-related deformations. Models such as SCAPE and its variants introduced pose-dependent shape changes, but their complex formulations made training difficult and computationally expensive. These models were also less compatible with standard graphics pipelines, limiting their practical use in real-time applications and animation systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome these issues, the SMPL (Skinned Multi-Person Linear) model was introduced as a data-driven and efficient human body representation. It models both body shape differences and pose-dependent deformations using a simple linear formulation based on joint rotations, making training easier with large 3D datasets. Since SMPL is based on blend skinning, it integrates well with existing rendering engines and produces more accurate results than earlier models like BlendSCAPE. Additionally, SMPL can simulate soft-tissue deformations, resulting in more realistic human motion and making it widely used in current research.
